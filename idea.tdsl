every single expression should have at least one (or more) threads of data that flow through it.
every expr should have a single example of what it is stored in source control.

you garden/edit/maintain/cultivate the tree of data.
  when code is changed, and the existing data tree becomes obsolute, you trim the branches of the data
  when new code appears, you grow the data thread along the new exprs in a stepper

as you edit the program, you use a web/humble ui to step through the changes and update the tree.

the data is integrated with repl, so that as you are writing code, you can see the value of any expr (nrepl protocol extension/similar).

the data makes it easy for new people to understand the program, examples for everything. (that new person could be you in the future).
   means you can confidently make changes to the code with only 
        checking the data tree,
   you don't have to check the integration tests to know if your code breaks anything for small changes.

each thread of data going through system could represent a "user story" kind of. or maybe "request story" as used in scrum terms.

maintain as part of repo (in something similar to .clojure-lsp), but keep it in source control. 

extensions:

could potentially be used by tooling to
  * automatically generate specs
  * generate type definitions of programs. (do something PL-ish)
  * give good examples and integrate with a LMM (github copilot?) to speed up several different parts of process.
  * given data (maintained/cultivated/real, not LLM generated), and existing code, LLM could generate new snippets, and UI could click them/test populate them for you.
